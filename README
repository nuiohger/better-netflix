Webpack is used to be able to run the Add-on in browsers. The Add-on is developed with TypeScript. The source code is located in the src directory. The build directory contains the built JavaScript files by tsc. The build.py file is used to run tsc, Webpack and create the zip files. No minifiers are used.

To build the Add-on tsc, webpack and python must be installed. The build.py file runs the tsc and webpack commands if it is executed like this:
python build.py -rb

The script creates the JavaScript files generated by tsc in the build directory. Webpack is used to merge these files into one JavaScript file. That file is called Main.js and the script creates it in the current directory.
